## [2.2.0b1] - 2026-03-31 — Architectural Cleanup

Beta release focused on internal discipline rather than new features.

### Changed — Architecture

- **main.py decomposition**: Extracted `SearchPipeline`, `MemoryWritePipeline`, `OrchestrationEngine` from the 6,129-line monolith. main.py is now ~3,100 lines (49% reduction).
- **Public surface**: `dhee/__init__.py` rewritten for clean, narrow exports. `Memory = CoreMemory` (not FullMemory). Cognitive subsystems intentionally kept internal.
- **MCP split**: `mcp_slim.py` (4-tool product surface) vs `mcp_server.py` (24-tool power surface). Clear separation of concerns.

### Changed — Rename Debt

- All `FADEM_*` env vars → `DHEE_*` (with `FADEM_*` fallback for backward compat).
- Internal `fadem_config` → `fade_config` across memory package.
- Default collection name `fadem_memories` → `dhee_memories`.
- Config field `MemoryConfig.engram` → `MemoryConfig.fade`.
- CLI, MCP server, observability, presets: all `engram` product references removed.

### Added — D2Skill Policy Improvements

- **Dual-granularity policies**: `PolicyGranularity.TASK` (strategy) vs `PolicyGranularity.STEP` (local correction). Inspired by D2Skill (arXiv:2603.28716).
- **Utility scoring**: EMA-smoothed performance delta tracking on policies. Three-signal retrieval ranking (condition match + sigmoid utility + UCB exploration bonus).
- **Utility-based pruning**: `PolicyStore.prune()` removes deprecated policies first, protects validated ones.
- **Buddhi wiring**: `reflect()` accepts `outcome_score`, computes baseline vs actual delta, feeds it to policy `record_outcome()`.

### Fixed

- `buddhi.py`: Replaced dead `memory.get_last_session_digest()` call with working `get_last_session()` import.
- `mcp_server.py`: Fixed wrong "8 tools total" comment (actually 24), fixed `-> Memory` type hints (Memory not imported).
- CLI: Wired `benchmark` command into parser (existed but was unreachable).
- `PolicyStore.prune()`: Fixed bug where `candidates.pop()` pruned validated policies instead of deprecated ones.
- CHANGELOG 2.1.0: Removed false "Production/Stable" and "A-grade" claims.

### Changed — Packaging

- Version: 2.1.0 → 2.2.0b1
- Classifier: `Development Status :: 4 - Beta` (was falsely claiming Production/Stable)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-30 — Cognition Primitives

Dhee V2.1: Adds first-class cognitive primitives (episodes, tasks, policies, beliefs, triggers) and a 60-test suite that exercises them. These are internal building blocks — the public API remains the 4-operation surface (remember/recall/context/checkpoint).

### Added — Cognitive Primitives (internal, importable from `dhee.core`)

- **Episode System** (`dhee/core/episode.py`): Temporal unit of agent experience. Lifecycle: open→active→closed→archived→forgotten. Boundary detection via time gap and topic shift. Utility-based selective forgetting. JSON-file-backed persistence (suitable for local-first use; production systems should own their own persistence).
- **Task State** (`dhee/core/task_state.py`): Structured task tracking with goal/plan/progress/blockers/outcome. Step-level tracking. Blocker management. Plan success rate analysis.
- **Policy Cases** (`dhee/core/policy.py`): Outcome-linked condition→action rules with Wilson score confidence. Auto-promotion and auto-deprecation based on win rate.
- **Belief Tracking** (`dhee/core/belief.py`): Confidence updates with evidence tracking. Contradiction detection via keyword overlap + negation patterns. Revision history.
- **Trigger System** (`dhee/core/trigger.py`): 5 trigger types (keyword, time, event, composite, sequence) returning `TriggerResult(fired, confidence, reason)`. Backwards-compatible bridge from legacy intentions.
- **Test Suite** (`tests/test_cognition_v3.py`): 60 tests covering cognition primitives, contrastive pairs, heuristic distillation, meta-learning, and Buddhi pipeline wiring.

### Changed

- **Buddhi**: HyperContext expanded with episodes, task_states, policies, beliefs. `reflect()` creates contrastive pairs, distills heuristics, extracts policies, updates beliefs.
- **DheePlugin**: `checkpoint()` handles episode closure and task lifecycle. System prompt renderer includes strategies, beliefs, tasks, experience.
- **Version**: 2.0.0 → 2.1.0

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-30

Dhee V2: Self-Evolving Cognition Plugin. This release transforms Dhee from a memory layer into a **self-improving cognition plugin** that can make any agent — local or cloud, software or embodied — a HyperAgent that gets better with every interaction.

### Added — Phase 1: Universal Plugin

- **DheePlugin** (`dhee/adapters/base.py`): Framework-agnostic entry point wrapping Engram + Buddhi behind 4 tools (remember/recall/context/checkpoint), with session lifecycle (frozen snapshot pattern) and trajectory recording for skill mining.
- **DheeEdge** (`dhee/edge/`): Minimal-footprint offline plugin for hardware/humanoid deployment. All-local inference (GGUF + ONNX), embodiment hooks (`on_sensor_input`, `on_action_result`, `predict_environment`), <500MB working set.
- **BuddhiMini** (`dhee/mini/`): Scaffold for trainable model with 3 new task heads (`[MEMORY_OP]`, `[HEURISTIC]`, `[RETRIEVAL_JUDGE]`) on top of DheeModel. Includes `TraceSegmenter` that splits agent trajectories into `[REASON]/[ACT]/[MEMORY_OP]` spans for structured training data.
- Export `DheePlugin` from `dhee.__init__` and `dhee/adapters/__init__`.
- `pyproject.toml`: Added `edge` optional dependency group.
- `SamskaraCollector.get_training_data()`: Exports SFT samples, DPO pairs, and vasana reports for the training pipeline.
- `DheeLLM`: 3 new convenience methods (`classify_memory_op`, `generate_heuristic`, `judge_retrieval`).

### Added — Phase 2: Self-Evolving Cognition

- **ContrastiveStore** (`dhee/core/contrastive.py`): Success/failure pair storage with MaTTS re-ranking. Inspired by *ReasoningBank* (arXiv:2509.25140). Auto-creates pairs from `checkpoint(what_worked=..., what_failed=...)`. Exports DPO training pairs.
- **HeuristicDistiller** (`dhee/core/heuristic.py`): Distills abstract reasoning patterns at 3 levels (specific / domain / universal) from agent trajectories. Inspired by *ERL: Efficient Reinforcement Learning* (arXiv:2603.24639). Deduplicates via Jaccard similarity.
- **MetaBuddhi** (`dhee/core/meta_buddhi.py`): Self-referential cognition loop — proposes retrieval strategy mutations, evaluates them against samskara signals, promotes or rolls back. Inspired by *DGM-Hyperagents* (arXiv:2603.19461). The improvement procedure can improve itself.
- **RetrievalStrategy** (`dhee/core/strategy.py`): Versioned scoring weights stored as human-readable JSON files. Tunable knobs: semantic/keyword weights, recency boost, contrastive boost, heuristic relevance, context budgets.
- **ProgressiveTrainer** (`dhee/mini/progressive_trainer.py`): 3-stage training pipeline (SFT → DPO → RL gate). Inspired by *AgeMem* (arXiv:2601.01885). Weights samples by vasana degradation signals. Minimum thresholds prevent training on insufficient data.
- **HyperContext** gains `contrasts` and `heuristics` fields — agents now receive contrastive evidence (do/avoid) and learned heuristics at session start.
- **Buddhi** auto-wiring: `reflect()` auto-creates contrastive pairs and distills heuristics. `get_hyper_context()` populates contrasts and heuristics.
- **HybridSearcher**: Added `contrastive_boost` parameter — results aligned with past successes score higher.
- **EvolutionLayer**: Now runs dual loops — Nididhyasana (model training) + MetaBuddhi (strategy improvement).
- **SkillMiner**: Triggers heuristic distillation after successful skill mining.

### Added — Phase 3: Scale

- **EvolvingGraph** (`dhee/core/graph_evolution.py`): Extends KnowledgeGraph with entity versioning (append-only JSONL), personalized PageRank per user/agent, and schema-free entity extraction via LLM (entities are typed as `DYNAMIC` when they don't match the fixed schema).
- **HiveMemory** (`dhee/hive/hive_memory.py`): Multi-agent shared cognition on top of engram-bus. Agents publish insights, heuristics, and skills to the hive. Quality gating via Wilson score lower bound. Voting and adoption tracking.
- **CRDT Sync** (`dhee/hive/sync.py`): Offline/edge sync protocol. LWW-Register for content, G-Counter for votes, OR-Set for adoption lists. `SyncEnvelope` wire format (JSON over bytes). Nodes converge after arbitrary offline periods.
- **Framework Adapters**:
  - `dhee/adapters/openai_funcs.py` — `OpenAIToolAdapter` with `tool_definitions()` and `execute()` dispatch. Works with any API-compatible provider.
  - `dhee/adapters/langchain.py` — `get_dhee_tools()` returns 4 LangChain `BaseTool` instances. Lazy import — no hard dependency.
  - `dhee/adapters/autogen.py` — `get_autogen_functions()` for v0.2, `get_autogen_tool_specs()` for v0.4+. `register_dhee_tools()` for auto-registration.
  - `dhee/adapters/system_prompt.py` — `generate_snapshot()` renders HyperContext as a frozen system prompt block. Configurable sections, minimal mode for edge.
- **EdgeTrainer** (`dhee/edge/edge_trainer.py`): On-device micro-training. LoRA rank-4, CPU-only, <2GB RAM. Deferred training mode for GGUF models. Vasana-weighted sample emphasis.
- **KnowledgeGraph**: Added `DYNAMIC` entity type, `save()`/`load()` JSON persistence.

### Changed

- **Version**: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
- **MCP server** (`dhee/mcp_slim.py`): Refactored to wrap `DheePlugin` as backing singleton.
- **pyproject.toml**: Updated description, keywords, classifiers.

### Migration from V1

V2 is backwards-compatible with V1. Existing code using `Memory`, `Engram`, or `Dhee` classes continues to work unchanged. The new `DheePlugin` is additive — adopt it when you want the self-evolution capabilities.

```python
# V1 (still works)
from dhee import Memory
m = Memory()
m.add("fact")

# V2 (new universal plugin)
from dhee import DheePlugin
p = DheePlugin()
p.remember("fact")
ctx = p.context("what am I working on?")
prompt = p.session_start("fixing auth bug")
```
